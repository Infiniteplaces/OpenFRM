# OpenFRM
A powerful costs-calculation and life-cycle costs analysis (LCCA) tool – for developing, maintaining and operating multi-apartment buildings. It is primarily aimed at groups and communities that want to take the developement of their future housing environment into their own hands (but is not limited to this).

## what this tool does

OpenFRM gives insight in the anticipated financial flows during the process of developing your building and throughout a 35-years period of running it. OpenFRM takes into account all costs of constructing, financing, owning and operating the building.

• initial costs (starting up, design, acquisition / construction)

• finance charges (loan interest payments etc.)

• costs of operation, utilities (energy etc.) and maintenance

The result is a collection of sheets detailing the different categories of costs, their chronological ordering as well as their implications during the lifespan of the building. As a result, it demonstrates  the costs of living for the period of 35 years for the different unit types proposed.

## why this is relevant

Initiating, constructing and operating a multi-apartment building is a daunting task. Not only due to the wealth of issues to be taken into account, but equally because envisioning and testing different scenarios is a highly complex endeavour. However, **it is exactly with this "design" of parameters that a group of residents gains the power over their future housing reality.** Thus, OpenFRM has come to life to aid this ambition.

## how OpenFRM is installed

The tool can be downloaded directly from this repository, or as a zip package (including additional documantation) from the [MOBA.coop](http://www.moba.coop) website. It comes in the form of an .ods file (OpenDocument Spreadsheet file).

You can open the .ods file with LibreOffice or any compatible tool.

## the sections of the OpenFRM spreadsheet

OpenFRM is built around a spreadsheet. When you open the file, you arrive at the landing page. In the menu bar in the bottom you will apart from the Landing Page find 6 different sections (“tabs”): Inputs / Outputs, Design, Build, Finance, Maintain & Operate and finally the Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA). By clicking the different tabs, you can navigate through the document.
With the Design and Build section you get an overview of the actual investment into the project, with Finance the structure and cost of capital, while Maintain & Operate brings you to the logic of keeping the building up & running on the long-term. The LCCA shows the cash-flow, financial performance and viability of your project over the long term.

## the use of input/output fields

Each of the 6 sections has fields that are marked in blue (your input required), black (output automatically generated by the tool, no input required) or yellow (summary, no input required). In short: the fields marked in blue will need your input. Be cautious when Do not changing the data in the black sections, as the links inside the spreadsheet will “break” and the tool stops working correctly! (If you are confident with modifying the spreadsheet, be free to do so.)

## expanding data fields

Inside the 6 sections you will find that parts of the sheet may be summarized. In that case, a “+” sign will indicate that detailed information is available but has been collapsed. To expand such a collapsed part of a section, simply click the “+” sign.

## in which branch takes the development place

The stable release can be found in the "master" branch, while testing & development takes place in the "beta" branch.

## how to get help

OpenFRM is provided as-is. A manual is available at [MOBA.coop](https://www.moba.coop/).

You can open issues on GitHub. If you need to contact the coordinators for other reasons, use: openfrm@moba.coop

## initial development

OpenFRM has been initiated by [STEALTH.unlimited](www.stealth.ultd.net) and the team of [Ko Gradi Grad (Who Builds the City, Belgrade)](https://www.kogradigrad.org/), and collectively tested and reviewed within the [MOBA network](https://www.moba.coop/). [Creative Industries Fund NL](https://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/) has provided funding to develop it as a tool for the wider community of emerging housing initiatives and co-operatives. It is open source, provided 'as-is', and you can tweak it to fit your purpose.
