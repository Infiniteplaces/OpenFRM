# OpenFRM
A powerful costs-calculation and life-cycle costs analysis (LCCA) tool – for developing, maintaining and operating multi-apartment buildings. It is aimed at groups and communities that want to take the developement of their future housing environment into their own hands.

## - what this tool does

OpenFRM gives insight in the anticipated financial flows during the process of developing your building and throughout a 35-years period of running it. OpenFRM takes into account all costs of constructing, financing, owning and operating the building.

• initial costs (starting up, design, acquisition / construction)
• finance charges (loan interest payments etc.)
• costs of operation, utilities (energy etc.) and maintenance

The result is a collection of sheets detailing the different categories of costs, their chronological ordering as well as their implications during the lifespan of the building. As a result, it demonstrates  the costs of living for the period of 35 years for the different unit types proposed.

## - why it is relevant

Initiating, constructing and operating a multi-apartment building is a daunting task. Not only due to the wealth of issues to be taken into account, but equally because envisioning and testing different scenarios is a highly complex endeavour. However, **it is exactly with this "design" of parameters that a group of residents gains the power over their future housing reality.** Thus, OpenFRM has come to life to aid this ambition.

## - how OpenFRM should be installed

The tool can be downloaded directly from this repository, or as a zip package (including additional documantation) from the MOBA.coop website. It comes in the form of an .ods file (OpenDocument Spreadsheet file).

You can open the .ods file with LibreOffice or any compatible tool.

## - about the sections of the OpenFRM spreadsheet

OpenFRM is built around a spreadsheet. When you open the file, you arrive at the landing page. In the menu bar in the bottom you will apart from the Landing Page find 6 different sections (“tabs”): Inputs / Outputs, Design, Build, Finance, Maintain & Operate and finally the Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA). By clicking the different tabs, you can navigate through the document.
